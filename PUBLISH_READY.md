## 🛑 Final Step: Push the Button

Since I cannot log in to your npm command line, you need to execute the final command.

### 1. Login to npm (if not logged in)
```bash
npm login
```

### 2. Publish
```bash
npm publish --access public
```

---

That's it! Eat will be live on npm as `@eatjs/cli`.

## 📦 What gets published?
- `dist/` (The binary)
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `package.json`

## 🎉 Congratulations!
Eat v0.1.0 is ready for the world. 🥟
